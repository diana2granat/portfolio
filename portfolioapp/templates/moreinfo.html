            <p id="positions2">Embarking on a new chapter in my programming journey! After working as a programmer in the realm of electrical devices, I've found myself drawn back to the world of coding, and this time, I'm diving into the exciting universe of Hi-Tech software.
            I chose Python, because it's the powerhouse that fuels my passion for data engineering. From the algorithms that powered electrical devices to the algorithms that now drive data processing and analysis, Python has become my language of choice on this thrilling new adventure.
